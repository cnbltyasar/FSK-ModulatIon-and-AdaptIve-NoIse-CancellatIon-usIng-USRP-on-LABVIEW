# FSK-Modulation-and-Adaptive-Noise-Cancelation-using-USRP-on-LABVIEW
The objective of this project is to design a communication system that suppresses periodic noises and 
error correction on received audio signals using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). 
Firstly, the frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation technique was used to send data through the 
channel as a telecommunication part. Secondly, RLS adaptive filtering methodology was used to 
extract determined periodic noise on a signal including jet, fan, saw and drill background noises. In 
addition, (7,4) hamming code was used to encode binary data, and hard decision and soft-decision 
decoding techniques were implemented to observe the difference between these two error correction 
methodologies.
-To use the project files in LabVIEW select the path of the MATLAB files and text files provided in the project file from the panel in "adc.m path" selector.
-Then choose the desired noise from the "Noise Selection" part in both RX and TX.
-Then run the TX and RX programs in order.
